# üç≤ Case Study: Swiggy

## 1. Introduction
Swiggy, founded in 2014, is India‚Äôs largest online food delivery platform. Unlike Zomato, which started as a discovery app, Swiggy was *delivery-first* from day one. Its obsession with logistics and customer experience helped it scale rapidly.

## 2. Problem It Solved
Swiggy‚Äôs founders noticed that restaurants often lacked their own delivery fleet. Customers had to rely on restaurants with delivery boys or visit in person. Swiggy solved:
- *Logistics gap* ‚Äì offered restaurants outsourced delivery.
- *Customer wait time* ‚Äì faster deliveries using a dense fleet.
- *Reliability* ‚Äì real-time tracking & quick refunds.

## 3. Business Model
- *Commission* on each order from restaurants.
- *Delivery charges* from customers.
- *Subscription (Swiggy One)* for free delivery & deals.
- *New verticals* ‚Äì Swiggy Instamart (quick commerce), Swiggy Genie (pick & drop).

## 4. Product Strategy
- *Focus on delivery fleet* ‚Äì biggest differentiator.
- *Technology-driven logistics* (route optimization, dark stores).
- *Diversification* ‚Äì groceries, courier services, cloud kitchens.
- *Customer retention* ‚Äì through ‚ÄúSwiggy One‚Äù subscription.

## 5. Strengths
- Strong *delivery ecosystem* (drivers + tech).
- Faster adoption of *quick commerce* compared to Zomato.
- High customer satisfaction in Tier 1 & Tier 2 cities.

## 6. Challenges
- *Cash burn* in quick commerce (Instamart).
- *Intense price war* with Zomato.
- *Gig worker unrest* due to pay & incentives.

## 7. Key Takeaways
Swiggy differentiated itself by being *delivery-first*, and that strategy gave it a competitive edge. But profitability in food + quick commerce is still the biggest hurdle.
